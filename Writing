For integrated writing, I referred to the lectures of [Vince](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hE411Z7jy/?vd_source=60f6847f59e6e86038eb1f8d8f799383). 

For academic writing , I also referred to the lectures of [Vince](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UJ411T7oN/?vd_source=60f6847f59e6e86038eb1f8d8f799383).

# Integrated Writing

## Lecture 1 - Grading, Structure and Reading Analysis

### Key take-aways

1. CONTENT and COHERENCE matters the most!

2. Integrated writing is NOT the place to show off language skills - let templates do the work for you.

3. No personal ideas. Just select information from the listening and express them coherently and accurately.

### The Three Question Styles

* Opposition
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passage."

* Problems and Solutions
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they answer the specific problems presented in the reading passage."

* Solutions and Problems
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they cast doubt on specific solutions presented in the reading passage."

### Reading and Listening Structures

What to do before countdown:

Because each point in reading fits each point in speaking.

### Reading Analysis and Note Taking

Key steps in reading analysis:

1. Record the main idea of intro and each point.

2. Establish a coherent summary on each point.

3. Skim through the details in each point.

**Coherence** is very important! A fact leads to a result.

## Lecture 2 - Listening Analysis and Writing Structure

Key steps in listening analysis:

1. Have and EXPECTATION for the main idea of each point in listening based on points in reading.

2. Capture the MAIN IDEA - hold your expectation before the main idea is stated, and don't be distracted by details.

3. Capture as many DETAILS as you can.(But MAIN IDEA still comes first!)

### Listening Analysis and Note Taking

"it is certainly possible" and "One solution" are double warnings.

> **Writing Structure - Intro**
In the reading material, the author cites three reasons to support his/her viewpoint that (summary of reading info). Nevertheless, the lecturer in the listening meterial argues that (summary of listening material), and opposes the points in the reading material.
**Let the structure to show off your language facility!*
First and foremost, the author argues that (reading point 1 main idea). However, the lecturer offers an opposite stand that (listening point 1 + details).
In addition, the lecturer casts doubt on the author's another reason that (reading point 2 + main idea), demonstrating that (listening point 2 + details).
Finally, the author's third reason that (reading point 3 + main idea) is also counteracted by the lecturer who points out that (listening point 3 + details).

### Writing Structure

## Lecture 3 - Putting Everything Together

### Rules of thumb

1. $>=250$ words

2. Reading/Listening preferably between 1/1.5 and 1/2（阅读和听力材料的比例）

3. Organize a clear flow of idea before showing off language skills

### Example

### Key Takeaways

1. MODIFY and memorize your own writing structure

2. Convey the main idea before diving into details

3. Punctuations(in reading material) can help you a lot in writing!


# Academic Writing 

## Lecture 1 - Intro

### Time

At around 10:30am -> Writing Part 1 - Integrated Writing

At around 11am -> Writing Part 2 - Academic Discussion

Academic discussion takes up 10 minutes. Including reading and analyzing materials and writing in the box.

### Composition

Question type:

| Evaluation | Comparison | Solution | Argument |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 40% | 30% | 15% | 15% |

Topics:

| Education | Work | Environment | Tech | Urban Development | Economy | Social Issues |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 25% | 20% | 15% | 15% | 15% | 5% | 5% |

### Criteria

- Relevant and well-elaborated explanations, exemplifications and/or details

- Effective use of a variety of syntactic structures and precise, idiomatic word choice

- Almost no lexical or grammatical errors other than those expected from a competent writer writing under timed conditions (e.g. common typos or common misspellings or substitutions like there/their)

1. Topic
120-180 words of relevant discussion with reasoning, example, and preferably concession

2. Coherence
Clear topic, flow of idea, and connection between sentences

3. Language
Various, accurate and natural

4. Grammar
A mix of simple and complex sentences, preferably with attributive clauses and participles

### Comparison

Content expression is far more important than showing off skills. Being brief, accurate and natural is better than being complicated, which is perhaps different from our habits in high school.
