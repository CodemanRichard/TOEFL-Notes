## Lecture 1 - Grading, Structure and Reading Analysis

### Key take-aways

1. CONTENT and COHERENCE matters the most!

2. Integrated writing is NOT the place to show off language skills - let templates do the work for you.

3. No personal ideas. Just select information from the listening and express them coherently and accurately.

### The Three Question Styles

* Opposition
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passage."

* Problems and Solutions
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they answer the specific problems presented in the reading passage."

* Solutions and Problems
"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they cast doubt on specific solutions presented in the reading passage."

### Reading and Listening Structures

What to do before countdown:

Because each point in reading fits each point in speaking.

### Reading Analysis and Note Taking

Key steps in reading analysis:

1. Record the main idea of intro and each point.

2. Establish a coherent summary on each point.

3. Skim through the details in each point.

**Coherence** is very important! A fact leads to a result.

## Lecture 2 - Listening Analysis and Writing Structure

Key steps in listening analysis:

1. Have and EXPECTATION for the main idea of each point in listening based on points in reading.

2. Capture the MAIN IDEA - hold your expectation before the main idea is stated, and don't be distracted by details.

3. Capture as many DETAILS as you can.
