### TOEFL Speaking Myths

- Graders give penalty to templates? <font color=red>Wrong.</font>

- Your accent influences your speaking score? <font color=red>It depends... If accent influences your clear expression, it will have problems. I think I have no problem speaking clearly.</font>

- You need to give your thinking or opinion? <font color=red>Not really. The thing is that what we say should precisely fit the requirements of the problem.</font>

### New Changes

More information, we need to grasp the key information.

Example:

> Q: Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes.
**I think there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes. One of the advantages, you know, one of the major ones is that** the teacher will be able to find out which areas are the ones that the student needs to improve on. And the teacher will be able to find out students' understanding of the important topics in certain subjects. **In the meantime**, I think there is also a big disadvantage of surprise quizzes. Because some students might get very nervous during a surprise quiz, so he or she may not be able to do well on the test. **As a result**, his or her confidence will be shaken by surprise quizzes. **What is worse** is that the student might even lose his or her interest in the subject.

As you can see, he expressed it clearly and logically. For more examples please refer to the video on bilibili.

### TOEFL Scoring Guides

- Independent Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. Include delivery, language use and topic development. Small pauses or accents are fine, use of words and coherent expression are more important. <font color=red>Do misuse words, don't shift to topics that don't match the problem!</font>

- Integrated Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. We need to bring all information of the listening part into our speaking.
