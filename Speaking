## Lecture 1: Introduction

Agenda:

- TOEFL Speaking Myth Busters

- New Changes in 2018 and 2019

- TOEFL Scoring Guides

### TOEFL Speaking Myths

- Graders give penalty to templates? <font color=red>Wrong.</font>

- Your accent influences your speaking score? <font color=red>It depends... If accent influences your clear expression, it will have problems. I think I have no problem speaking clearly.</font>

- You need to give your thinking or opinion? <font color=red>Not really. The thing is that what we say should precisely fit the requirements of the problem.</font>

### New Changes

More information, we need to grasp the key information.

Example:

> Q: Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes.
**I think there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes. One of the advantages, you know, one of the major ones is that** the teacher will be able to find out which areas are the ones that the student needs to improve on. And the teacher will be able to find out students' understanding of the important topics in certain subjects. **In the meantime**, I think there is also a big disadvantage of surprise quizzes. Because some students might get very nervous during a surprise quiz, so he or she may not be able to do well on the test. **As a result**, his or her confidence will be shaken by surprise quizzes. **What is worse** is that the student might even lose his or her interest in the subject.

As you can see, he expressed it clearly and logically. For more examples please refer to the video on bilibili.

### TOEFL Scoring Guides

- Independent Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. Include delivery, language use and topic development. Small pauses or accents are fine, use of words and coherent expression are more important. <font color=red>Do misuse words, don't shift to topics that don't match the problem!</font>

- Integrated Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. We need to bring all information of the listening part into our speaking.


## Lecture 2: Speaking Task 1

Agenda:

- Five task one styles

- Response to style one to four

- Response to style five

### Response to style one to four

Because new TOEFL doesn't include this speaking test anymore, we won't go too deep here, just enjoy the sample question.

Step 1 - State your point
In my opinion; Whenever I think of; I think...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Let me elaborate my reasons; Let me tell you why...

Step 3 - point 1
"First of all..." + An elaboration(not an example)

Step 4 - point 2
"Second..." + A personal example

> Sample Question: "A friend of yours is having difficulty adapting to the environment of the new school. What advice would you give to him or her?"
In my opinion, my friend can join a hobby club and socialize with other students.
Now, let me elaborate my reasons.
**First**, my friend will find it easier to initiate a conversation or communicate with other students in the club. **To be specific**, students sharing the same hobbies, such as sports, model building, or computer games, will have common topics to talk about. **Thus**, my friend will feel less nervous meeting new people.
**Second**, club activities will effectively bond students together. **For example**, I previously joined the debate club of the school, and built a deep friendship with other students through organizing a debate contest. **In addition**, I even got to know students from other universities through the contest.
