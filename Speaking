## Lecture 1: Introduction

Agenda:

- TOEFL Speaking Myth Busters

- New Changes in 2018 and 2019

- TOEFL Scoring Guides

### TOEFL Speaking Myths

- Graders give penalty to templates? <font color=red>Wrong.</font>

- Your accent influences your speaking score? <font color=red>It depends... If accent influences your clear expression, it will have problems. I think I have no problem speaking clearly.</font>

- You need to give your thinking or opinion? <font color=red>Not really. The thing is that what we say should precisely fit the requirements of the problem.</font>

### New Changes

More information, we need to grasp the key information.

Example:

> Q: Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes.
**I think there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes. One of the advantages, you know, one of the major ones is that** the teacher will be able to find out which areas are the ones that the student needs to improve on. And the teacher will be able to find out students' understanding of the important topics in certain subjects. **In the meantime**, I think there is also a big disadvantage of surprise quizzes. Because some students might get very nervous during a surprise quiz, so he or she may not be able to do well on the test. **As a result**, his or her confidence will be shaken by surprise quizzes. **What is worse** is that the student might even lose his or her interest in the subject.

As you can see, he expressed it clearly and logically. For more examples please refer to the video on bilibili.

### TOEFL Scoring Guides

- Independent Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. Include delivery, language use and topic development. Small pauses or accents are fine, use of words and coherent expression are more important. <font color=red>Do misuse words, don't shift to topics that don't match the problem!</font>

- Integrated Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. We need to bring all information of the listening part into our speaking.


## Lecture 2: Speaking Task 1

Agenda:

- Five task one styles

- Response to style one to four

- Response to style five

### Response to style one to four

Because new TOEFL doesn't include this speaking test anymore, we won't go too deep here, just enjoy the sample question and guideline.

Step 1 - State your point
In my opinion; Whenever I think of; I think...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Let me elaborate my reasons; Let me tell you why...

Step 3 - point 1
"First of all..." + An elaboration(not an example)

Step 4 - point 2
"Second..." + A personal example

> Sample Question: "A friend of yours is having difficulty adapting to the environment of the new school. What advice would you give to him or her?"
In my opinion, my friend can join a hobby club and socialize with other students.
Now, let me elaborate my reasons.
**First**, my friend will find it easier to initiate a conversation or communicate with other students in the club. **To be specific**, students sharing the same hobbies, such as sports, model building, or computer games, will have common topics to talk about. **Thus**, my friend will feel less nervous meeting new people.
**Second**, club activities will effectively bond students together. **For example**, I previously joined the debate club of the school, and built a deep friendship with other students through organizing a debate contest. **In addition**, I even got to know students from other universities through the contest.

### Guidelines

- Avoid repeating words / do not copy from the prompt. Vary (show off) your vocabulary as much as possible.

- Use transitional words / phrases. In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthermore...etc

- Use some complex expressions.


## Lecture 3 - Speaking Task 2

### Three Question Styles

Type 1 - Preference

"Some people prefer to stay in touch with their friends and family while traveling. Other people do not. Which do you prefer? Include details and examples to support your explanation."

"Do you prefer to study alone or in a study group? Include details and examples in your explanation."

Type 2 - Agree / Disagree

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Being polite is more important than being truthful. Use details and examples in your response."

"State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: promoting competition would improve students' academic performance."

Type 3 - Advantage / Disadvantage

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in a big city? Include details and examples in your answer."

"A lot of college students take on part-time jobs during academic semesters, while others focus on their study. Talk about the advantages and disadvanteges of taking part-time jobs for college students. Include details and examples in your answer."

### How to Answer

#### Preference & Agree / Disagree

Template:

Step 1 - State your point
In my opinion...; I personally prefer...; I agree/disagree with the idea that...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Let me elaborate my reasons; I have this preference for two reasons...

Step 3 - point 1
"First..." + "To be specific" + An elaboration(not an example)

Step 4 - point 2
"Second..." + A personal example

> Sample Question: Preference
"Some people prefer to stay in touch with their friends and family members while traveling. Other people do not. Which do you prefer? Include details and examples to support your explanation."
I personally prefer to stay in touch with my family whenever I go.
I feel this way for the following reasons.
**First**, my family members could give my tips regarding my trip. **To be specific**, family members can give or help look up useful info regarding where to visit, eat, or shop, especially if they have previously been there. **As a result**, it might save you time and money if you keep in touch with family members.
**Second**, sharing my trip with my family makes me happier. **For example**, I visited Spain last year and shared photos and videos of sightseeing spots with them. The smile on their face made me happy and I enjoyed my trip even more. **In addition**, I felt as if my family were traveling together with me.

> Sample Question: Agree/Disagree
"State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: promoting competition would improve students' academic performance."
In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that competition would lead to improvement in students' academic performance.
Now, let me tell you why.(Personally don't prefer this expression)
First, it causes stress. For most students, test itself is stressful enough, and making tests a competition will undoubtedly lead to huge stress, discouraging students and resulting in failure in academic performance.
Second, it will potentially lead to negative competition. For example, almost everyone had a heart for winning when I was in high school. Making test a competition invoked a deep ambition to win that some students even chose to cheat in the tests to win.

#### Advantages/Disadvantages

Template for Advantages/Disadvantages:

Step 1 - Intro
There are certainly both advantages and disadvantages of...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Every coin has two sides. Let me elaborate the two sides of...

Step 3 - Advantages
"First of all, one major advantage of xxx is..." + Elaboration (1-3 sentences)

Step 4 - Disadvantage
"Meanwhile, an obvious advantage of xxx is..." + Elaboration (1-3 sentences)

Step 5 - Optional Opinion(Personally I won't say this because it has nothing to do with the question and wastes time)
In general, I would like to...

> Sample Question: Advantage/Disadvantage
"A lot of college students take on part-time jobs during academic semesters, while others focus on their study. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of taking part-time jobs for college students. Include details and examples in your answer."
There are certainly both advantages and disadvantages of taking part-time jobs during school semesters.
(I personally won't say the coin sentence)Every coin has two sides. Let me elaborate the two sides of taking part-time jobs.
First of all, one major advantage is a practical learning experience. To be more specific, students will be able to apply their knowledge into real life. For instance, a business-major will learn a lot about how to operate a business through simply working as a writer or waitress.
Meanwhile, an obvious disadvantage is distraction. Students could easily fall behind due to time conflicts, fatigue from part-time jobs, or even fail in tests.
(Personally I won't take this)In general, I still think part-time jobs are helpful as they can help students to find better jobs in their field of study.

### Guidelines

Same as Lecture 2


## Lecture 4 - Speaking Task 3

### Structure

First, you will READ about a change in the form of a letter, announcement, proposal, or something similar. There will then almost always be two reasons given for the change.

Next, you will HEAR two students talking about the change. One student will support/oppose the change with reasons. These reasons will usually support/oppose the reasons in the reading.

Task 3 will typically ask: The student expresses his/her opinion of the university's plan/change/proposal; State his/her opinion and reasons.

### Sample Question

> **Reading Content**(less important)
Change:
dining hall will be converted into dining club for one week at the end of each semester
Reason 1:
will help cooking majors later on in their careers
Reasons 2:
small fee for special gourmet food
**Listening Content**(MORE IMPORTANT)
Opinion:
Agree / great idea / good for students in cooking programs
Reason 1:
Student's cousin participated -> more people more pressure -> people waiting and easy to make mistakes -> good practice
Reason 2:
Students make fancy meals at a small cost -> much cheaper than good restaurants in town -> worth the small cost since as good as in expensive restaurants

For reasons, the more information written on scratch paper, the better(but don't influence your listening). And your reasons should form a link chain, which means each part of them are logically connected. And reasons from listening part may have connection with reading part, so we can have some anticipations about that.

### Template

- Step 1 - State the change
According to the announcement / proposal / letter...

- Step 2 - State reasons for change
First, this is because...
Another reasons is that...

- Step 3 - State the opinion
The student (does not) think this is a great idea for two reasons.

- Step 4 - Reason 1
"First, he/she mentions that..."

- Step 5 - Reason 2
"Besides, he/she also mentions that..."

### Sample Response

> Change:
According to the announcement, the university dining hall will be converted into a dining club for one week at the end of each semester.
First, this is because the dining club will help cooking majors later on in their careers.
Another reason is that students will pay a small fee for special gourmet food.
The girl thinks this is a great idea for two reasons.
First, she mentions that her cousin participated in the program. It is different from classes because more people means more pressure, and students will tend to make mistakes if people are waiting. Thus, the dining club will be a good practice.
Besides, she also mentions that cooking students make fancy meals at a small cost, and it is much cheaper than good restaurants in town. It is worth the small cost since the food is as good as in expensive restaurants.

### My Question

If speaking fluently, yes, this template will perfectly fit the 60s limit. But what if I need to think and say in the test? I need to check out the answer to this by doing some real test.

### Guidelines

1. Use transitional word / phrases
In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthurmore...etc

2. Listening material is more important
Allocate AT MOST 20 seconds for reading

3. If you don't have time for or missed the reasons in reading
Relax. It's not important. You can still get a "GOOD"

4. Use complex expressions if you can

### Vince's Personal Experience

1. This task is ALMOST unchanged since the launch of iBT in 2006.

2. There will ALWAYS be two reasons. The other student will occasionally interrupt and try to confuse you.
