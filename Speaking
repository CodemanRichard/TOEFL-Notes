## Lecture 1: Introduction

Agenda:

- TOEFL Speaking Myth Busters

- New Changes in 2018 and 2019

- TOEFL Scoring Guides

### TOEFL Speaking Myths

- Graders give penalty to templates? <font color=red>Wrong.</font>

- Your accent influences your speaking score? <font color=red>It depends... If accent influences your clear expression, it will have problems. I think I have no problem speaking clearly.</font>

- You need to give your thinking or opinion? <font color=red>Not really. The thing is that what we say should precisely fit the requirements of the problem.</font>

### New Changes

More information, we need to grasp the key information.

Example:

> Q: Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes.
**I think there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of surprise quizzes. One of the advantages, you know, one of the major ones is that** the teacher will be able to find out which areas are the ones that the student needs to improve on. And the teacher will be able to find out students' understanding of the important topics in certain subjects. **In the meantime**, I think there is also a big disadvantage of surprise quizzes. Because some students might get very nervous during a surprise quiz, so he or she may not be able to do well on the test. **As a result**, his or her confidence will be shaken by surprise quizzes. **What is worse** is that the student might even lose his or her interest in the subject.

As you can see, he expressed it clearly and logically. For more examples please refer to the video on bilibili.

### TOEFL Scoring Guides

- Independent Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. Include delivery, language use and topic development. Small pauses or accents are fine, use of words and coherent expression are more important. <font color=red>Do misuse words, don't shift to topics that don't match the problem!</font>

- Integrated Speaking Rubrics: Full score is 4. We need to bring all information of the listening part into our speaking.


## Lecture 2: Speaking Task 1

Agenda:

- Five task one styles

- Response to style one to four

- Response to style five

### Response to style one to four

Because new TOEFL doesn't include this speaking test anymore, we won't go too deep here, just enjoy the sample question and guideline.

Step 1 - State your point
In my opinion; Whenever I think of; I think...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Let me elaborate my reasons; Let me tell you why...

Step 3 - point 1
"First of all..." + An elaboration(not an example)

Step 4 - point 2
"Second..." + A personal example

> Sample Question: "A friend of yours is having difficulty adapting to the environment of the new school. What advice would you give to him or her?"
In my opinion, my friend can join a hobby club and socialize with other students.
Now, let me elaborate my reasons.
**First**, my friend will find it easier to initiate a conversation or communicate with other students in the club. **To be specific**, students sharing the same hobbies, such as sports, model building, or computer games, will have common topics to talk about. **Thus**, my friend will feel less nervous meeting new people.
**Second**, club activities will effectively bond students together. **For example**, I previously joined the debate club of the school, and built a deep friendship with other students through organizing a debate contest. **In addition**, I even got to know students from other universities through the contest.

### Guidelines

- Avoid repeating words / do not copy from the prompt. Vary (show off) your vocabulary as much as possible.

- Use transitional words / phrases. In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthermore...etc

- Use some complex expressions.


## Lecture 3 - Speaking Task 2

### Three Question Styles

Type 1 - Preference

"Some people prefer to stay in touch with their friends and family while traveling. Other people do not. Which do you prefer? Include details and examples to support your explanation."

"Do you prefer to study alone or in a study group? Include details and examples in your explanation."

Type 2 - Agree / Disagree

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Being polite is more important than being truthful. Use details and examples in your response."

"State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: promoting competition would improve students' academic performance."

Type 3 - Advantage / Disadvantage

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in a big city? Include details and examples in your answer."

"A lot of college students take on part-time jobs during academic semesters, while others focus on their study. Talk about the advantages and disadvanteges of taking part-time jobs for college students. Include details and examples in your answer."

### How to Answer

#### Preference & Agree / Disagree

Template:

Step 1 - State your point
In my opinion...; I personally prefer...; I agree/disagree with the idea that...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Let me elaborate my reasons; I have this preference for two reasons...

Step 3 - point 1
"First..." + "To be specific" + An elaboration(not an example)

Step 4 - point 2
"Second..." + A personal example

> Sample Question: Preference
"Some people prefer to stay in touch with their friends and family members while traveling. Other people do not. Which do you prefer? Include details and examples to support your explanation."
I personally prefer to stay in touch with my family whenever I go.
I feel this way for the following reasons.
**First**, my family members could give my tips regarding my trip. **To be specific**, family members can give or help look up useful info regarding where to visit, eat, or shop, especially if they have previously been there. **As a result**, it might save you time and money if you keep in touch with family members.
**Second**, sharing my trip with my family makes me happier. **For example**, I visited Spain last year and shared photos and videos of sightseeing spots with them. The smile on their face made me happy and I enjoyed my trip even more. **In addition**, I felt as if my family were traveling together with me.

> Sample Question: Agree/Disagree
"State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: promoting competition would improve students' academic performance."
In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that competition would lead to improvement in students' academic performance.
Now, let me tell you why.(Personally don't prefer this expression)
First, it causes stress. For most students, test itself is stressful enough, and making tests a competition will undoubtedly lead to huge stress, discouraging students and resulting in failure in academic performance.
Second, it will potentially lead to negative competition. For example, almost everyone had a heart for winning when I was in high school. Making test a competition invoked a deep ambition to win that some students even chose to cheat in the tests to win.

#### Advantages/Disadvantages

Template for Advantages/Disadvantages:

Step 1 - Intro
There are certainly both advantages and disadvantages of...

Step 2 - Optional Transition
Every coin has two sides. Let me elaborate the two sides of...

Step 3 - Advantages
"First of all, one major advantage of xxx is..." + Elaboration (1-3 sentences)

Step 4 - Disadvantage
"Meanwhile, an obvious advantage of xxx is..." + Elaboration (1-3 sentences)

Step 5 - Optional Opinion(Personally I won't say this because it has nothing to do with the question and wastes time)
In general, I would like to...

> Sample Question: Advantage/Disadvantage
"A lot of college students take on part-time jobs during academic semesters, while others focus on their study. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of taking part-time jobs for college students. Include details and examples in your answer."
There are certainly both advantages and disadvantages of taking part-time jobs during school semesters.
(I personally won't say the coin sentence)Every coin has two sides. Let me elaborate the two sides of taking part-time jobs.
First of all, one major advantage is a practical learning experience. To be more specific, students will be able to apply their knowledge into real life. For instance, a business-major will learn a lot about how to operate a business through simply working as a writer or waitress.
Meanwhile, an obvious disadvantage is distraction. Students could easily fall behind due to time conflicts, fatigue from part-time jobs, or even fail in tests.
(Personally I won't take this)In general, I still think part-time jobs are helpful as they can help students to find better jobs in their field of study.

### Guidelines

Same as Lecture 2


## Lecture 4 - Speaking Task 3

### Structure

First, you will READ about a change in the form of a letter, announcement, proposal, or something similar. There will then almost always be two reasons given for the change.

Next, you will HEAR two students talking about the change. One student will support/oppose the change with reasons. These reasons will usually support/oppose the reasons in the reading.

Task 3 will typically ask: The student expresses his/her opinion of the university's plan/change/proposal; State his/her opinion and reasons.

### Sample Question

> **Reading Content**(less important)
Change:
dining hall will be converted into dining club for one week at the end of each semester
Reason 1:
will help cooking majors later on in their careers
Reasons 2:
small fee for special gourmet food
**Listening Content**(MORE IMPORTANT)
Opinion:
Agree / great idea / good for students in cooking programs
Reason 1:
Student's cousin participated -> more people more pressure -> people waiting and easy to make mistakes -> good practice
Reason 2:
Students make fancy meals at a small cost -> much cheaper than good restaurants in town -> worth the small cost since as good as in expensive restaurants

For reasons, the more information written on scratch paper, the better(but don't influence your listening). And your reasons should form a link chain, which means each part of them are logically connected. And reasons from listening part may have connection with reading part, so we can have some anticipations about that.

### Template

- Step 1 - State the change
According to the announcement / proposal / letter...

- Step 2 - State reasons for change
First, this is because...
Another reasons is that...

- Step 3 - State the opinion
The student (does not) think this is a great idea for two reasons.

- Step 4 - Reason 1
"First, he/she mentions that..."

- Step 5 - Reason 2
"Besides, he/she also mentions that..."

### Sample Response

> Change:
According to the announcement, the university dining hall will be converted into a dining club for one week at the end of each semester.
First, this is because the dining club will help cooking majors later on in their careers.
Another reason is that students will pay a small fee for special gourmet food.
The girl thinks this is a great idea for two reasons.
First, she mentions that her cousin participated in the program. It is different from classes because more people means more pressure, and students will tend to make mistakes if people are waiting. Thus, the dining club will be a good practice.
Besides, she also mentions that cooking students make fancy meals at a small cost, and it is much cheaper than good restaurants in town. It is worth the small cost since the food is as good as in expensive restaurants.

### My Question

If speaking fluently, yes, this template will perfectly fit the 60s limit. But what if I need to think and say in the test? I need to check out the answer to this by doing some real test.

### Guidelines

1. Use transitional word / phrases
In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthurmore...etc

2. Listening material is more important
Allocate AT MOST 20 seconds for reading

3. If you don't have time for or missed the reasons in reading
Relax. It's not important. You can still get a "GOOD"

4. Use complex expressions if you can

### Vince's Personal Experience

1. This task is ALMOST unchanged since the launch of iBT in 2006.

2. There will ALWAYS be two reasons. The other student will occasionally interrupt and try to confuse you.


## Lecture 5 - Speaking Task 4

Task 4

First, you will READ about an academic topic (100 words), with biology, psychology, business being very common; It has a CLEAR TITLE, some introduction, and descriptive details.

Next, you will HEAR a short lecture with one or two examples of the topic. They might be from the speaker's personal life. If there is only one example, it will ALWAYS have two parts - before / after or cause / effect.

Typical Task 4 Format:

Using the example(s) from the lecture, explain what XXX(topic in the lecture) is.

### Style 1: Two Examples

> Reading material:
Target Marketing
Advertisers in the past have used radio and television in an attempt to provide information about their products to large, general audiences; It was once thought that the best way to sell a product was to advertise it to as many people as possible. However, more recent trends in advertising have turned toward target marketing. Target marketing is the strategy of advertising to smaller, very specific audiences - audiences that have determined to have the greatest desire or need for the product being marketed. Target marketing has proved to be very effective in reaching potential customers.

> Note Taking:
Reading content(less important)
Topic: Target Marketing
Definition: Marketing strategy for smaller, specific audiences
Details: For audiences that have a need for the product, effective in reaching potential customers

Listening part can be found in TPO 5 Speaking Task 4

> Listening content(MORE IMPORTANT)
Example 1:
TV commercial for certain programs -> cellphone during young people programs -> fun to use, bright color, kids have good time with peers -> phone made for them
Example 2:
During business show -> need to show how efficient, handle business easily -> same phone -> two commercials to two different groups of people

#### Template

Step 1 - State the topic
TOPIC is MAIN DEFINITION

Step 2 - Provide details
The reading states that...

Step 3 - Optional transition
The lecturer elaborates on the topic by providing an example / two examples

Step 4 - Reason 1
"First, he/she mentions that..."

Step 5 - Point 2
"Second, he/she says that..."

#### Sample Response

Target marketing is a strategy to reach smaller and specific audiences.
The reading states that it is effective in reaching potential customers who have a desire or need for the product.
The professor illustrates the idea using two examples.
First, he mentions the strategy of making TV commercials of cellphone specifically for young people. In these commercials, the cellphones are fun to use, in bright color, and the kids using them are also having a good time with their peers. As a result, kids will believe these phones are made for them.
In the meantime, the professor also mentions that the same cellphone is also in commercials between TV programs for business people. In these commercials, the phones are shown to be efficient and effective in solving business problems. In summary, the same product is depicted differently for different groups of people.

### Style 2: One Example

#### Note Taking

TPO 7 Speaking Task 4

> Behavior Modification
Individuals often modify their behavior based on what they have learned about the possible consequences about their actions. When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior results in pleasant consequence, that behavior is likely to be repeated. An unpleasant consequenece, on the other hand, discourages further repetition of the behavior. While behavior modification can be observed in experiments, it also occurs frequently in everyday settings, when individuals change their behavior based on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior.

> Reading content(less important)
Topic: Behavior modification
Definition: Individuals modify their behavior based on possible consequences of their actions
Details: Pleasant experience leads to repetition; Unpleasant experience discourages repetition; frequent in life

> Listening content(MORE IMPORTANT)
Example(Before): Kids starting school -> not used to class rules -> may misbehave like interrupting classes, walking around the classroom when supposed to sit down
Example(After): Teacher angry and punish -> misbehaving kids sit at desks when others play -> kids learn what get them in trouble -> raise hand when ask questions, sit quietly and pay attention will be rewarded -> teachers tell them she's proud; put happy face stickers on homework -> kids learn to behave in the way for good reaction from the teacher

*Tips*: Sometimes taking notes in Chinese can be faster than in English

#### Template

The same as style 1

#### Sample Response

Behavior modification is a phenomenon that people base their actions on what they have learned about possible consequences.
The reading states that pleasant experience leads to repetition of actions, while unpleasant experience discourages repetition.
The professor illustrates the idea using a common example.
First, he mentions when kids just begin studying at schools, they are not used to following ruls. For example, they might interrupt classes or walk around the classroom when they are supposed to sit down and focus.
Then, the teacher gets angry. The teacher might punish the misbehaving kids by having them sit at their desks when other kids are allowed to play. In this way kids learn what will get them into trouble. Meanwhile, kids learn that if they raise their hands when ask questions, and sit quietly and pay attention during classes they will be rewarded. Teachers say they are proud and put smilely faces on students' homework. Thus, kids learn to behave in the way that get them positive feedback.

### Guidelines

1. Use transitional words/phrases
In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthermore...

2. Listening material is more important
Allocate AT MOST 20 seconds for reading

3. If you don't have time for or missed some details in reading
Relax, it's not important. You can still get a "GOOD"

4. Use complex expressions and explain the examples in detail if you can


## Lecture 6 - Speaking Task 5

Not included, because it's not tested in TOEFL anymore.

## Lecture 7 - Speaking Task 6

Task 6 Style

First, you will HEAR a 2-2.5 min academic lecture with a clear topic - a variety of topics including biology, sociology, business, history, and art are all very common.

The lecture will start with a 3-5 sentence short introduction of the topic, followed by TWO examples with details, or one example with TWO clear parts.

<font color=red>
The task is essentially asking you to:

Summarize the listening material in a STRUCTURED manner
</font>

*30 seconds for preparation and 60 seconds to speak

The following example is from TPO 5 Speaking Task 6

> **Lecture Topic**: Motivation / what drives us to do things in life - buy a car, choose a career
**Part 1 topic:**
Extrinsic / External motivation
Detail(s):
The desire to behave in a way for external reward; not as long-lasting as the other
Example(s):
Child does housework such as throwing out garbage or washing dishes for a small monetary reward; might not continue if no reward
**Part 2 topic:**
Intrinsic / Internal motivation
Detail(s):
We do something because we enjoy it; gives us a sense of accomplishment
Example(s):
Go to gym several times per week because feel energized and know for good health; feel good about it and kept going for a long time

### Template

Step 1 - State the topic
In the lecture, the professor talks about XXX(lecture topic), which is (details and definition)

Step 2 - Optional transition
He/She uses two(an) example(s) to illustrate the idea.

Step 3 - Part 1
First, the professor discusses (Part 1 topic)
"Details + Example 1"

Step 3 - Part 2
Second, he/she furthur discusses (Part 2 topic)
"Details + Example 2"

### Sample Response

> **State the topic:**
In the lecture, the professor talks about motivation. Motivation drives us to do what we do in our daily life such as buying a car or choosing a career.
**Optional Transition:**
Two examples are used to illustrate the idea.
**Part 1 and details:**
First, the professor mentions extrinsic motivation, which is the desire to behave in a certain way due to external rewards such as money. It usually does not last as long as intrinsic motivation.
For example, children usually do housework such as throwing out trash or washing dishes if they are given a small amount of money as a reward. However, children might not be willing to do such work if they are not given a reward.
**Part 2 and details:**
Second, the professor furthur talks about intrinsic motivation, which drives us to do things because we enjoy it or it gives us a sense of accomplishment.
For instance, the professor says that he goes to gym for several times every week because he feels energized after going there and he knows that sports is good for health. He feels good and keeps going for an extended period of time.

### Guidelines

1. Use transitional words / phrases
In general, thus, as a result, in addition, furthermore...etc

2. Focus on the examples
Spend less time on introduction

3. Past tense and simple present tense are both ok, but simple present might be easier

4. Use complex expressions and explain in detail if you can

5. Summarize, and no need to give your own thoughts
